- [x] On successful login, store user information in localStorage.
- [ ] Protect routes by checking for user authentication status.
- [ ] Security Measures:
- [ ] Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- [ ] Consider using HTTP-only cookies for storing sensitive information in a production environment.

3. Shopify Storefront API Integration
- [x] Create Shopify Development Store: Set up a development store via Shopify Partners.
- [x] Generate Storefront Access Token:
- [x] Navigate to your Shopify admin panel.
- [x] Go to Apps > Manage private apps > Create a new private app.
- [x] Enable Storefront API access and select necessary permissions.
- [x] Securely Store Credentials: Place your Storefront API token in environment variables (.env file) and access them in your application using import.meta.env.

4. Product Listing
- [x] Fetch Products:
- [x] Use the Storefront API‚Äôs products query to retrieve product data.
- [x] Implement pagination for product listings.
- [x] Display Products:
- [x] Design product cards using Tailwind CSS.
- [x] Include product images, titles, prices, and ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù buttons.

5. Shopping Cart Functionality
- [x] Create Cart Context:
- [x] Utilize React Context API to manage cart state globally.
- [x] Add to Cart:
- [x] Implement functionality to add products to the cart using the cartLinesAdd mutation.
- [x] Update Cart Items:
- [x] Allow users to update quantities or remove items using cartLinesUpdate and cartLinesRemove mutations.
- [x] Persist Cart State:
- [x] Store cart ID in localStorage to maintain cart state across sessions.

6. Checkout Process
- [ ] Initiate Checkout:
- [ ] Use the checkoutCreate mutation to start the checkout process.
- [ ] Redirect users to the checkout.webUrl provided in the response.
- [ ] Handle Checkout Completion:
- [ ] After payment, Shopify will redirect users back to your site.
- [ ] Capture the order ID and display order confirmation details.

7. Razorpay Integration
- [ ] Set Up Razorpay Account:
- [ ] Sign up on Razorpay and complete the KYC process.
- [ ] Generate API Keys:
- [ ] Obtain your Key ID and Key Secret from the Razorpay dashboard.
- [ ] Integrate Razorpay Checkout:
- [ ] Use Razorpay‚Äôs Checkout.js to open the payment modal.
- [ ] Pass necessary details like amount, currency, and order ID.

- [ ] Update order status accordingly.

8. Order Confirmation
- [ ] Display Order Details:
- [ ] Show order summary, including items purchased, total amount, and payment status.
- [ ] Send Confirmation Email:
- [ ] Integrate an email service (like SendGrid) to send order confirmations to users.

9. Security Best Practices

- [ ] Use environment variables and server-side functions to handle sensitive operations.
- [ ] Input Validation:
- [ ] Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides.
- [ ] HTTPS:
- [ ] Ensure your application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

10. Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Testing:
- [ ] Write unit tests for components and integration tests for API interactions.
- [ ] Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
- [ ] Deployment:
- [ ] Choose a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify for frontend deployment.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
